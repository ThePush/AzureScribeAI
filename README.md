<h1 align="center">Azure Scribe AI</h1>

<p align="center">
This project is a simple fork of <a href="https://github.com/ajikan/ScribeAI">ScribeAI</a> that uses Azure OpenAI instead of OpenAI.

Scribe AI is a ChatGPT-like extension for VS Code. Now you can have an AI chatbot like ChatGPT right in VS Code! Use it as your AI programming assistant which you can talk with to understand complex code, modify and improve your code, or generate comments for your code. The possibilities are endless. To start, highlight a piece of code and click on the plus icon on the left to open up a chat and start talking with Scribe AI just like in ChatGPT! All your conversations are saved in your workspace so you can look back on them as notes.

-   üß† **AI Edit:** Highlight a piece of code and click on the chat icon, then enter the instruction on how you want the AI to modify the code such as `Refactor the code to include comments`, `Rewrite the code in Python`, and much more! The possibilities are endless. Now finally hit `AI Edit` button and you will see that your selected code has been modified. If you don‚Äôt like the result you can always Undo it by pressing `Mac:` <kbd>‚åò Command</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd>, `Windows:` <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> or go to `Edit -> Undo`. Sometimes the formatting of the result is not correct or your originally highlighted section gets messed up, in such cases you can rehighlight the code and ask AI to `Reformat the code so that it‚Äôs correct` and press the `AI Edit` button.
