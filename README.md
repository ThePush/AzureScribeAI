# 📢 v2.0 Release
- Based on the original <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AndrewZhang.scribeai">ScribeAI</a> v1.2.1
- I have added the ability to use it with Azure OpenAI.

# 🚀 Getting Started
## 📦 Installation
- To use this extension, you can either install it from the VSCode marketplace or download and install `.vsix` file from Releases.

### 📑 Download extension from VSCode Marketplace
- Click on the Extensions icon(Ctrl+Shift+X)

- Search for `AzureScribeAI`

- The extension on VSCode marketplace looks like this, click the install button.

- Once installation is complete, go to settings and search for `AzureScribeAI` to add your Azure OpenAI API key, endpoint and deployment name. When you install and use Azure ScribeAI for the first time, it will ask you for your Azure OpenAI API key, endpoint and deployment name.

## ⚙️ Settings
- You can also change your API key, endpoint and deployment name in User Settings via `Code` -> `Preferences` -> `Settings` and under `Extensions` you will find `AzureScribeAI` settings. Or you can just search `AzureScribeAI` in search box.
